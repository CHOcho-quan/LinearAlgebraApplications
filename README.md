- Channel Decoding
  - Communicating through a noisy channel. Using a codebook to recover all the information from the noisy observation.
- Sparsity Recovering (Compressed Sensing)
  - Compressing a high-dimensional channel into low-dimensional information. Recover the high-dimensional channel using s-sparsity
  - NP Problem, but we can use greedy algorithm to get a relatively efficient & correct answer
- PCA
  - What's PCA: find a subspace that minimizes the MSE of data projection onto the subspace.
